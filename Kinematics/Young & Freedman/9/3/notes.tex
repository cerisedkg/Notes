\maketitle
The distance that a point on a rotating body moves is: $$s = r\theta$$where $s$ is the distance, $r$ is the distance from the axis of rotation, and $\theta$ is the angle in radians that the point has moved.

Taking derivatives of both sides with respect to time, we get that $$v = r\omega$$ $$a_{tan} = r\alpha$$.

To find centripetal acceleration, we have $$a_{rad} = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2 r$$
