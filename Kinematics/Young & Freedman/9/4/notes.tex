\maketitle
\begin{definition}[Moment of Inertia]
The \textbf{moment of inertia} of a given body is a measure of how far mass is distributed through an axis of rotation. It is given by $$I = m_1r_1 + m_2r_2 + ... + m_nr_n$$where $m$ is an infintesimal particle and $r$ is the distance of that particle from the axis of rotation. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Kinetic Energy of a Rotating Body]
The \textbf{kinetic energy} of a rotating body is given by: $$K = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2$$
