\begin{definition}[Independent Events]
Two events, $E$ and $F$ are \textbf{independent} if $$P(E\cap F) = P(E)\times P(F)$$Two events that are not independent are \textbf{dependent}.  
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
    A card is selected at random from an ordinary deck of $52$ playing cards. If E is the event that the selected card is an ace and F is the event that it is a spade, then E and F are independent. This follows because $P(E\cap F) = \frac{1}{52}$, whereas $P(E) = \frac{4}{52}$ and $P(F) = \frac{13}{52}$
\end{example}
