Hello! This is a repository for self-study notes from Alexander Liang, an undergrad majoring in Math and Physics in UCI's Class of 2028.

# **Purpose:**

The purpose of this project is to provide abridged study guides for future reference, and for anyone who is learning the topics covered in this collection.
I believe that teaching is the best way to learn a topic yourself, so I create study guides as a way to grasp topics better!

Most of the topics in this repository are taught through self-study, although I may take classes on them at UCI afterwards.

This repo is a living document, and you can see my style shift over time as I develop new tools and techniques for creating better notes.

# **Setup:**
Most of the writing is done in LaTex using MacTex/TexLive, with a custom package called alexconfig, which provides the block highlighting and formatting for the document.
Alexconfig can be accessed in the Alexconfig repo on my profile.
I edit the document in VSCode using LaTeX Workshop, with custom macros to help facilitate live typing in lecture.

# **Schedule:**
Updates will be sporadic, apologies in advance

# **TODO:**
- Create a style guide outlining the philosophy and formatting of the project
- Find cool new features to add to alexconfig
- Update macros
- Practice live-typing LaTex.
