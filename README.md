Hello! This is a repository for self-study notes from Alexander Liang, a college student in UCI's Class of 2028.

# **Purpose:**

The purpose of this project is to provide abridged study guides for future reference, and for anyone who is learning the topics covered in this collection.
I believe that teaching is the best way to learn a topic yourself, so I create study guides as a way to grasp topics better!

Most of the topics in this repository are taught through self-study, although I may take classes on them at UCI afterwards.

This repo is a living document, and you can see my style shift over time. 
In the beginning, I copied chapters in the textbooks word for word, but now, I prioritize clarity, originality, and conceptual understanding over rigor.
The current philosophy will be in the style guide.

# **Setup:**
Most of the writing is done in LaTex using MacTex/TexLive, with a custom package called alexconfig, which provides the block highlighting and formatting for the document.
Alexconfig can be accessed in the Alexconfig repo on my profile.
I edit the document in VSCode using LaTeX Workshop, with custom macros to help facilitate live typing in lecture.

# **Schedule:**
I split subjects into two categories: Permanent and Pleasure.
Subjects in the permanent category are for classes that I am currently taking or subjects that I need to study urgently.
Subjects in the pleasure category are topics I find personally interesting and are learned via self-study. 

I will try to complete a chapter for every subject in the permanent category at least once per business day, with exceptions in case of illness and injury, holidays, or other extenuating circumstances.
I will try to complete one chapter from one subject in the pleasure category every day, though this is conditional on whether I have the time and willpower to continue studying at the end of the day.

Subjects in the Permament category:
- Abstract Algebra
- Probablity
- Differential Equations
- Math Methods
- Kinematics

All other subjects are in the Pleasure category.

# **TODO:**
- Create a style guide outlining the philosophy and formatting of the project
- Find cool new features to add to alexconfig
- Update macros
- Practice live-typing LaTex.
