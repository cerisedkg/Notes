\section{Motivation}
We want to introduce three useful types of rings: Polynomial Rings, Matrix Rings, and Group Rings.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Rings]
A polynomial ring $R[x]$ is a ring with members $r$ of the form $$r = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + a_{n-2}x^{n-2} + ... + a_1x + a_0$$where $a_0, a_1, ... ,a_n$ are real numbers with standard addition of like terms and multiplication of polynomials. Its pretty easy to see that this is a ring. 

Notice that the ring of real numbers $R$ is a subring of $R[x]$, when the highest degree is degree zero.
