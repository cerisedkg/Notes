\title{8.1: Momentum and Impulse}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{definition}[Momentum]
\textbf{Momentum} is denoted $p$ and is given by $$\vec{p} = m\vec{v}$$or the mass of a particle times its velocity. This has a relation with Newton's Second Law: $$F_{net} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Impulse]
The \textbf{impulse} of an object $\vec{J}$ is the change in momentum: $$\vec{J} = \vec{p}_1 - \vec{p}_0 = \Delta \vec{p}$$It is also the integral of net force with respect to time: $$\vec{J} = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \vec{F}_{net} dt = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} dt = \vec{p}_1 - \vec{p}_0$$
\end{definition}

The difference between energy and momentum is that a change in momentum is due to impulse, which depends on the time over which a force acts, whereas changes in energy are due to work, which depends on the distance over which a force acts.
