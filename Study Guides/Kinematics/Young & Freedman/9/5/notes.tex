\begin{definition}[Parallel Axis Theorem]
The \textbf{parallel axis theorem} state that if we have a moment of inertia about center of mass of a body, $I_{cm}$, then the moment of inertia about any other axis parallel to the first, $I_P$ is given by $$I_P = I_{cm} + md^2$$where $m$ is the mass of the body and $d$ is the distance between the two.
