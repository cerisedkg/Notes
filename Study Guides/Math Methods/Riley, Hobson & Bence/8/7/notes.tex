\begin{definition}[Complex Conjugate of a Matrix]
The \textbf{complex conjugate} of a matrix is found by taking the complex conjugate of each component. It is denoted $A^*$.

If $A$ is real, then $A^* = A$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Hermitian Conjugate of a Matrix]
The \textbf{hermitian conjugate} of a matrix is found by taking the complex conjugate of the transpose of a matrix, and is denoted $A^\dagger$

$A^\dagger = (A^*)^T = (A^T)^*$

If $A$ is real, then $A^\dagger = A^T$
\end{definition}

The inner product of two vectors in an orthonormal basis, $\langle a\vert b\rangle = a^\dagger b$, or the matrix product of the hermitian conjugate of $a$ times $b$. 

If the basis is not orthonormal, then $\langle a \vert b \rangle = a^\dagger Gb$, where $G$ is the matrix with components $G_{ij} = \langle \mathbf{e}_i \vert \mathbf{e}_j \rangle$
