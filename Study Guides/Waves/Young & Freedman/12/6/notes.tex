\maketitle

\begin{definition}[Viscosity]
\textbf{Viscosity} is a measure of internal friction of a fluid. 
\end{definition}
Fluids with high viscosity have interesting flow dynamics and often cling to surfaces. When in a pipe, the fluid near the center will flow faster than the fluid near the edges.

\begin{definition}[Turbulence]
\textbf{Turbulence} describes how chaotic the flow of a fluid is 
\end{definition}

Laminar flow is when flow is orderly, and flow lines are straight

Turbulent flow is flow that is chaotic with vortices.s
