\section{Philosophy}

The goal of this project is to catalog the subjects that I have learned, to assist learning by ensuring I grasp concepts through restating them in the study guides, and to provide clear, concise, and easy to read guides for myself and others to use.

There are four key tenets that this project abides by:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Readability: Do not use any unnecesary jargon or confusing language. State and explain all concepts so that they are understandable even if you lobotomized half of your brain.
    \item Thoroughness: Proofs should be as thorough as they were in the book, or even more. Take the time to explain every step of thinking when solving problemss.
    \item Completeness: A completed study guide should cover every topic that the book does. Do not miss content.
    \item Originality: Make sure all content is stated in your own words, even if it is clunky and not as eloquent. Otherwise, you are copying from the book, and not actually learning.
\end{enumerate}
